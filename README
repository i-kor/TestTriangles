Build with CMake
From repository root folder run these commands:
    > mkdir build
    > cd build
    > cmake ..\src
    > cmake --build .
Usage
Run executable providing a name of input file as a first argument, and a mode as a second
Mode could be 2D or 3D
If no argument is provided the program will try to read a file "..\input3D.txt" in a 3D mode
Example:
    > main ..\input2D.txt 2D
    > main

This program should work correctly in 2D mode
In 3D mode it was not properly tested and it doesn't take in to account some cases such as overlapping triangles etc.
